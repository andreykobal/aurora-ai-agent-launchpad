## Problem Statement

In today’s digital ecosystem:
- **Digital Engagement:** Communities need interactive and engaging digital personas.
- **Fragmented Platforms:** Traditional methods of community growth on platforms like Twitter and Discord are siloed and manual.
- **Complexity in Tokenization:** Creating, managing, and authenticating digital personas across channels requires robust technical solutions.

The current solutions do not seamlessly integrate AI-driven content with blockchain-based verification and social media automation.

---

## Proposed Solution

AVA AI Agent Launchpad provides an all-in-one solution that:
- **Creates AI Agents:** Utilize AI (via OpenAI and Civitai APIs) to generate compelling character details, images, and dialogue.
- **Tokenizes Personas:** Deploy a smart contract that creates an ERC20 token for each AI agent, ensuring on-chain uniqueness and ownership.
- **Enables Automated Interaction:** Integrates chat capabilities and connects with platforms like X (Twitter), Discord, and Telegram for automated engagement.

---

## Technical Approach & Architecture

### Frontend & Client-Side
- **React & Next.js (App Router):** The project uses client components (note the `'use client';` directive) for dynamic interactions.
- **Web3 Integration:**  
  - **RainbowKit & Wagmi:** For seamless wallet connection and blockchain transactions.
  - **QueryClient (TanStack React Query):** For robust data fetching and caching.
- **UI Libraries & Icons:**  
  - Uses `react-icons` for visual elements.
  - Implements responsive design with Tailwind CSS classes.

**Key Code Snippet (Frontend Initialization):**

```javascript
// RainbowKit & Query Client configuration
const config = getDefaultConfig({
  appName: 'AVA AI Agent Launchpad',
  projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID,
  chains: [baseSepolia],
  transports: {
    [baseSepolia.id]: http(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL),
  },
  ssr: true,
});
```

### AI & Media Generation
- **OpenAI API Integration:**  
  - Generates character details and image prompts.
  - Example usage:  
    ```javascript
    const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', { ... });
    ```
- **Civitai API:**  
  - Used for generating images based on prompts.
- **Pinata SDK:**  
  - Uploads generated images to IPFS for decentralized storage.

**Highlighted Helper Function:**

```javascript
async function uploadImageToPinata(imageUrl) {
  // Fetch image and convert to blob
  const response = await fetch(imageUrl);
  const blob = await response.blob();
  const file = new File([blob], "generated-image.png", { type: blob.type });
  
  // Initialize Pinata SDK with JWT & gateway URL
  const pinata = new PinataSDK({
    pinataJwt: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT,
    pinataGateway: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_URL,
  });
  
  // Upload file and construct gateway URL
  const uploadResponse = await pinata.upload.file(file);
  const pinataUrl = `https://${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_URL}/ipfs/${uploadResponse.IpfsHash}?pinataGatewayToken=${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_GATEWAY_TOKEN}`;
  return pinataUrl;
}
```

### Smart Contracts & Blockchain
- **Solidity Contracts:**  
  - **AIAgentFactory.sol:** Contains the logic for creating AI agents and deploying an ERC20 token per agent.
- **Key Functions:**
  - `createAIAgent`: Deploys a new AI agent token and stores agent metadata on-chain.
  - `getAllAIAgents` & `getAIAgentByToken`: For retrieving on-chain agent data.

**Highlighted Solidity Snippet:**

```solidity
function createAIAgent(
    string memory _name,
    uint256 _age,
    string memory _race,
    string memory _profession,
    string memory _bio,
    string memory _firstMessage,
    string memory _image
) public returns (address) {
    // Deploy a new AIAgentToken, minting 1e9 tokens to the creator.
    AIAgentToken token = new AIAgentToken(msg.sender, _name, "AIA");
    // Create a new agent struct and store on-chain.
    AIAgent memory newAgent = AIAgent({
        name: _name,
        age: _age,
        race: _race,
        profession: _profession,
        bio: _bio,
        firstMessage: _firstMessage,
        image: _image,
        tokenAddress: address(token)
    });
    agents.push(newAgent);
    tokenToAIAgent[address(token)] = newAgent;
    emit AIAgentCreated(_name, _age, _race, _profession, _bio, _firstMessage, _image, address(token), msg.sender);
    return address(token);
}
```
